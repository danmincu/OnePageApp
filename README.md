# OnePageApp

Windows, VS2017

This is a boilerplate app to be used as a starting point for a `single page flat looking WPF application` !!!

It includes Prism's regions, navigation, event aggregator, Microsoft unity for DI, custom flat controls derived from Mah Metro controls
and much more!
It has a functional side menu with few example screens and a ready to use `Go-Back` button for navigation.
It also includes flat dialog boxes (for displaying errors?) and a child window launcher if a modal dialog is needed.
